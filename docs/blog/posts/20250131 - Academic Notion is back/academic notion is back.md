# Academic Notion Is Back!

Dear users of [Academic Notion](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/academic-notion/gcgpnidgdaihkdebbccieaelpjomhfpg), I apologize for the extended period where Academic Notion wasn't working properly. I know many of you rely on this tool for managing your research papers in Notion, and I let you down by not addressing the issues sooner. 

I'm happy to announce that Academic Notion is now fully functional again. You can once again easily import papers from arXiv, Google Scholar, and Science Direct into your Notion database.

Thank you for your patience, and I'll strive to maintain the extension more actively going forward. If you have any problems, feel free to contact me via support@texcel.com

Happy researching!

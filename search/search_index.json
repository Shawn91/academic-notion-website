But then I switched to programming and gradually lost touch with English over the years. I watched my once-fluent English skills gradually slip away.  After years of minimal English practice, I decided it was time for a comeback starting from the beginning of 2025 (with the help of Notion of course) </p>"},{"location":"blog/2025/01/19/how-im-using-notion-to-get-my-english-back-a-simple-20-minute-daily-system/#1-the-challenge-of-language-maintenance","title":"1. The Challenge of Language Maintenance","text":"<p>Let's be honest \u2014 languages are like muscles. Without regular exercise, they weaken. Despite my professional background in interpretation, years of focusing solely on coding left my English skills rusty.</p> <p>So I developed a straightforward system using Notion to rebuild my language skills starting from the beginning of 2025.

Limitations and Considerations","text":"<p>Let's talk about the elephant in the room \u2014 no system is perfect, and I want to be totally honest about where this one could use some improvements.</p> <p>The \"Perfect Streak\" Challenge</p> <p>Right now, I'm on fire with my reviews - haven't missed a day since 2025 started! But let's be real - life happens. That's why I'm planning to add tracking columns in my database to monitor when I actually complete each review. It's not about beating myself up over missed days, but rather about having a clear picture of my consistency.</p> <p>Keeping It Casual (On Purpose)</p> <p>If you're familiar with Anki, you might be thinking, \"Hey, this isn't as sophisticated as Anki's algorithm!\" And you're absolutely right. While Anki is brilliant at adapting to how well you know each word, I deliberately chose a simpler approach. As a former Anki user myself, I wanted something more relaxed this time around. Sometimes, making things too \"serious\" can take the fun out of learning!</p> <p>The Trade-offs I'm Okay With</p> <ul> <li>The system is intentionally basic - no fancy algorithms here</li> <li>It doesn't track how well I know each word</li> <li>It's more about building a sustainable habit than achieving perfect retention</li> </ul> <p>Here's the thing - I'd rather have a simple system I actually use than a perfect one I might abandon. For me, this sweet spot between structure and flexibility works better than a more rigid approach. The goal isn't to create the most sophisticated learning system - it's to actually get my English skills back!</p> <ol> <li> <p>Disclaimer: the blog is written by myself and then polished by AI\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"blog/archive/2025/","title":"2025","text":""}]}
